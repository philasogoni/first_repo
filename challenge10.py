#  Have the function Division(num1,num2) take both parameters being passed and return the Greatest Common Factor.
# That is, return the greatest number that evenly goes into both numbers with no remainder. For example: 12 and 16 both
# are divisible by 1, 2, and 4 so the output should be 4. The range for both parameters will be from 1 to 10^3.
